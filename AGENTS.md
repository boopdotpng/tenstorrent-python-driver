# agents
Write excellent, concise code that solves problems elegantly.

## philosophy
**Every line must earn its keep.** Prefer readability over cleverness. If carefully designed, 10 lines can have the impact of 1000.

## style
- use 2 space indents everywhere 
- do not run a formatter after you write code
